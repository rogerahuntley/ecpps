# ecpps
my self-rolled c++ implementation of an ecs pattern

This library is being developed to help me learn C++, and is used in [my pacman clone](https://github.com/rogerthat52/snackman). It should be mostly functional for use in any other project, but it hasn't been battle-worn or fully tested yet.
